Any task has a text, description, optional - due date, status - completed or not. The task can be added or removed (regardless of the progress status).

Tasks can be grouped into goals. One task can only belong to one goal.
Objectives can be linked to each other in a hierarchy. A goal can have multiple subgoals, or optionally one top-level goal.
